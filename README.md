Hi,
My name is Aidan, I am excited to learn more about design and coding. I found my interest in this field while attempting to code a 3D animation for fun. Knowing that I would enjoy 3D animation and designing logos, I decided to apply for Interactive Media Design. My brother-in-law also attended this program (but at Durham College), and he suggested to me that I go towards getting a degree in this field. 

I originate from a smalltown up North, called Alliston. Us Allistonians jokingly call it Potatoville, because our town's main export is potatoes, vodka, and potato chips. Lay's uses our potatoes to make the majority of their chips, our main Vodka company is Beattie's (who also make han sanitizer), and our potatoes are sent worldwide. I wasn't born in Potatoland, but I was birthed in Etobicoke, Toronto. I have spent most of my time growing up in Alliston, Toronto, and London. My parents grew up in Rexdale and Etobicoke, and their endless stories about their time growing up in the suburbs of Rexdale and Etobicoke have made me envious of the 1980's and 90's. What a life they lived. 

My hobbies include reading, writing short stories, novellas, and novels. I enjoy playing guitar and writing new music for fun. I have played piano, drums, and bass guitar in the past. I collect as a hobby, most notably vintage coins (2001-prior, various nations), special coins (Olympic coins being the most notable), rocks, vinyl records, books, old letters, etc. 

# Jackel Grunt's Info

Hello there,
I am Jackel Grunt, a musician by night and a coder by day. I enjoy finding myself in coding situations as it is something I have practiced for more than ten years of my life. Starting at the age of 17, I began coding websites for local businesses in my hometown of Smole. The truth is, I find myself drawn to coding as a way of escaping the eyes of others. At night, I play with my band The Authoritarians, we usually play bars and don't get much in the way of income. This is where coding comes in. 

Again, I am from the town of Smole, Alabama. Never heard of it? That's fair, most people never had. I moved to Canada when I was twenty-four, to attend coding classes at Fanshawe. I found success in the field, so I stayed in London. My family remains in Alabama. I have two sisters, one is a dentist, the other is a mother of three. My father was a bricklayer, while my mother worked various jobs throughout the years. Mostly focusing on her motherly duties. Smole is known as a mining town, originally it's export was coal, but now the mining industry has died down. The population decreases as people have to leave to find work elsewhere. 

I enjoy playing guitar. I write music as much as possible, so my band has stuff to play. I can't sing, so I had my buddy Aaron join the band. He's an excellent lead singer. I try to do back up vocals but mostly I remain silent in voice. Coding is my hobby though. MY hobby. It's the one thing I am a master at. I tried to learn other instruments, but I always backed off of them. I can draw mountains, but nothing else.
