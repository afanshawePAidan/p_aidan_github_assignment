Hi,
My name is Aidan, I am excited to learn more about design and coding. I found my interest in this field while attempting to code a 3D animation for fun. Knowing that I would enjoy 3D animation and designing logos, I decided to apply for Interactive Media Design. My brother-in-law also attended this program (but at Durham College), and he suggested to me that I go towards getting a degree in this field. 

I originate from a smalltown up North, called Alliston. Us Allistonians jokingly call it Potatoville, because our town's main export is potatoes, vodka, and potato chips. Lay's uses our potatoes to make the majority of their chips, our main Vodka company is Beattie's (who also make han sanitizer), and our potatoes are sent worldwide. I wasn't born in Potatoland, but I was birthed in Etobicoke, Toronto. I have spent most of my time growing up in Alliston, Toronto, and London. My parents grew up in Rexdale and Etobicoke, and their endless stories about their time growing up in the suburbs of Rexdale and Etobicoke have made me envious of the 1980's and 90's. What a life they lived. 

My hobbies include reading, writing short stories, novellas, and novels. I enjoy playing guitar and writing new music for fun. I have played piano, drums, and bass guitar in the past. I collect as a hobby, most notably vintage coins (2001-prior, various nations), special coins (Olympic coins being the most notable), rocks, vinyl records, books, old letters, etc.
